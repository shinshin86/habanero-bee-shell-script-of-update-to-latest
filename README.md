# Habanero Bee shell script of update to latest

Shell script to update to the latest of Habanero Bee.

## NOTE

**If you have made any customizations of your own in Habanero Bee, those changes will be removed.
Note that you will be forced to change to the latest state of Habanero Bee.**

Note that this is almost like a script that is written off, and depending on how you use it, it may behave in unexpected ways.
I wrote this script to simplify the updating of the Habanero Bee site that I use.

## USAGE

Run this script at the root of the Habanero Bee project you want to update

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shinshin86/habanero-bee-shell-script-of-update-to-latest/main/update.sh)"
```
